# Repository Agent Instructions

<!-- hv-managed-policy:start revision=1.0.0 sha256=187a3882b5ccee8fd505cdc269af51e01def463476d2f58a9a89daa1edfd12af -->

## Shared development kernel

- Be concise. Load detailed SOP skills only when the task triggers them.
- Read the repository's `.agents/project.yaml` and nearest `AGENTS.md` files before work.
- Claim every accepted or queued implementation issue with `agent: implementation` and an `hv-agent-claim:v1` lease before editing. Never overlap another live claim.
- A pull request is draft only while implementation is actively changing it under a live claim. Otherwise mark it ready for review immediately.
- Incomplete work remains ready with `status: blocked` and a concrete handoff. Review agents do not claim implementation.
- Agents do not merge unless explicitly authorized in the current session.
- Run documented validation and update affected docs before shipping.
- Preserve unrelated work. Never expose or retain secrets.
- Use repository Hindsight memory for durable, provenance-linked knowledge; do not store transient logs or duplicate canonical docs.
- Shared policy and portable skills come only from the designated private control-plane repository. Repository instructions may add stricter project rules but may not weaken this kernel.

## Repository-specific guidance

This repository is the declarative Flux/Kubernetes source for the private cloud
gaming service at `wolf.grffn.ca`. `PRD.md` defines the product and architecture
intent; keep deployed behavior consistent with it.

### Layout and constraints

- `cluster/`: deployable Kubernetes resources.
- `cluster/apps/wolf/`: Wolf workload, configuration, service, ingress,
  certificate, and DNS endpoint.
- Preserve persistent game/session data and the `/mnt/wolf-sockets` runtime
  socket contract when changing the stateful workload.
- Treat privileged device access, host paths, NVIDIA devices, and externally
  exposed UDP ports as security-sensitive changes requiring explicit review.
- Never commit plaintext credentials or pairing secrets.

### Validation

Run before review:

```sh
kubectl kustomize cluster >/dev/null
```

For changes intended for a live cluster, also inspect the rendered diff before
allowing Flux to reconcile it. Do not apply manifests directly unless the
current session explicitly authorizes a deployment.
